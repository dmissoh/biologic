BioLogic

BioLogic is an Eclipse based RCP application I have developed for behavioral observation.
The idea is based on Observer, a DOS application used for the same purpose.
The aim of this application is to ease the work of scientists who want to record events during 
a behavioral observation.
An example of an observable process can be different behaviors a bumble bee shows when regulating brood temperature.
The example above is a real life Use-Case where BioLogic has been successfully utilized.

At the Department of Behavioral Physiology & Sociobiology (University of Wuerzburg), BioLogic has been tested for the first time during experiments performed with bumble bees.
BioLogic allows the user to record, log, visualize, export and backup events collected during an experimental run.
