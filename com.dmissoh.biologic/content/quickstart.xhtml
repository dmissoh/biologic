<h1>Welcome to BioLogic</h1>
<h2>Quick start</h2>
<p>This tutorial describes the main functionalities of this software.
</p>

<p>
After steps I) and II) you are able to configure
and run you first sequence. Steps III)-V) shows some advanced functionalities.
</p>

<img src="images/ToolbarAnnotated.jpg"/><br/>
The picture above shows the toolbar of BioLogic. Following buttons are available:

<ul>
	<li>(1) The 'New Sequence View...'</li>
	<li>(2) The 'Save' button</li>
	<li>(3) The 'Set Key Bindings...' button</li>
	<li>(4) The 'Export as CSV' button</li>
</ul>

<h3>I) Configure at least one event</h3>

<h4>Define the events and define the hot keys to use to record them</h4>

<p>First of all, you want to tell BioLogic which kind of event you want to record.<br/>
You can either directly click on the <b>[Set Key Bindings...]</b> button <img src="../icons/keybinding.png"/> in the toolbar or access the same configuration page through
using the menu <b>Window>Preferences</b>.<br/>
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/preferences_page.png"/><br/>
</p>

<p>
For you first run, just click on the <b>[New...]</b> button and than click on <b>[OK]</b> to store you first Event Key Binding setting.<br/>
</p>

<p>
In this simple example, you create a new event that can be started using the keyboard key <b>[A]</b> and
stopped using the keyboard key <b>[S]</b>.<br/> This is obviously not a punctual event, i.e. an event without duration.
</p>

<h4>Choose the time unit</h4>
On the same preference page, you can choose the time unit that the system should use to measure time differences (e.g. for the CSV export).

<h3>II) Record a sequence</h3>
<p>
<h4>Starting a sequence</h4>
To start a new sequence with the event configurations you done in step I), click on the <b>[New Sequence View...]</b> button <img src="../icons/sequence.png"/>.<br/>
The following dialog pop up:<br/>

<p>
<img src="images/start_sequence_dialog.png"/><br/>
</p>

<h4>Live and Recorded Mode</h4>

Sequences can be started in a two different mode: <b>Live</b> and <b>Recorded</b>.<br/>
In the <b>Live</b> mode, the current time is logged. In the <b>recorded</b> mode, a running sequence can be <b>paused</b>, and only the <b>elapsed</b> time is recorded.
</p>

<p>
Enter a short description or click the [OK] button to use the default description.<br/>
</p>


<h4>Control the running sequence</h4>
<p>s
A new view is opened and the new sequence can now been started by clicking the start/stop button <img src="../icons/startSequence.png"/>.<br/>
Now use the keys you define in step I) to start and end events (in this case the keys [A] and [S]).<br/>
</p>

<p>During the recording, the events are logged in the <b>Running events</b> view (located in the left panel of the application).</p>

<p>
<img src="images/running_events_view.png"/><br/>
</p>

<p>This view list all running event (i.e. the ones that havn't been closed) with their corresponding start and end hot keys.</p>

<p>At the end of your recording sequence, terminate your sequence by clicking on the start/stop button <img src="../icons/startSequence.png"/> again.</p>

<p>Every sequence is stored, and can be opened again by selecting it from the <b>Logs</b> view. This view is also located in the
left panel of the application.</p>

<p>
<img src="images/log_view.png"/><br/>
</p>

<p>Actions in the toolbar of the <b>Log View</b> give you the possibility to <b>delete all log files</b>, <b>open the folder</b> where they are stored or <b>refresh</b> the view.</p>

<h4>Running concurrent sequences</h4>
<p>BioLogic gives you the possibility to record more than one sequences at the same time. You can toggle between those instances with the following shortcut <b>[Shift] + [Tab]</b>.</p>

<h3>III) Generate a graphical representation of the sequence</h3>
<p>
Viewing the graphical representation of the new sequence is quite simple.
Just click the following button <img src="../icons/proceed.png"/>.
</p>

<h3>III) Exporting a sequence</h3>
<p>
The sequence you previously recorded can be exported as a CSV-File (Comma Separated Values) which can easily been opened in Excel.<br/>
Two type of exports are available and are accessible by clicking on the small down-arrow that is located close to the
export button <img src="../icons/export_xsl.png"/>:

<ul>
	<li>Export log entries</li>
	<li>Export grouped events</li>
</ul>

These commands are self explained. Just try them.

</p>


<h3>IV) Backup functionalities</h3>
<p>BioLogic offers an simple backup mechanism to backup all your work and export the result as a
compressed file (also known as zip files). By calling this command that is available over menu <b>Utilities>Backup</b>
all sequences as well as the csv files you generate from them are exported.
